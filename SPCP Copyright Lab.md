Copyright and Content Platforms
In this assignment, we will consider how YouTube enforces copyright, examining detailed
experimentation with the platform, including AI-generated content, and how it holds up against
copyright laws.
Task 1: Platform Copyright Policy Analysis
YouTube detects copyright material through two filters. First, they have an automated system
that is put to use in each practice. The uploaded content is scanned against a large database of
content that copyright owners provide to YouTube. If there’s a match, a Content ID claim is filed
on the video. In addition, they feature a manual reporting option where copyright owners can
manually send YouTube a DMCA removal request for content that infringes rules, leading to
copyright strikes.
When content is flagged as potentially infringing, this depends on which filter is violated. For
automatic Content ID claims, the copyright owner can choose between blocking the video,
monetizing the video, or tracking the video. However, it does not give a copyright strike in and
of itself. On the other hand, if the copyright owner sends a formal DMCA copyright removal
request, the video is removed, the channel gets a copyright strike, and accruing three strikes
within 90 days results in the termination of your account.
The appeals process is also split into two categories. If disputing a Content ID claim, you submit
it inside YouTube Studio. The copyright owner then has 30 days to respond. They can either
release the claim, uphold it, or request a takedown, which can turn into a strike. If your dispute is
rejected, you can sometimes file an appeal. On the other hand, for a DMCA-removed video, you
need to file a counter-notification, which is a formal legal request that says the takedown was a
mistake. YouTube will then forward this, and the responsible party has 10 business days to show
they filed a court case. If that’s not the case, YouTube will restore the video and remove the
strike.
With the monetization aspect, if the Content ID finds copyrighted material, the copyright owner
can choose what happens: they can monetize the video themselves, block the video, or just track
it for analytics. Even during a Content ID dispute, YouTube continues to collect ad revenue.
Once the dispute is resolved, earnings go to the winner.
Lastly, YouTube has a few different programs available for big copyright holders. The Content
ID program is one of them. It’s eligible to big copyright owners, like labels, studios, and big
```
networks. They upload their reference materials and set automatic rules (block, monetize, or
```
```
track). They serve as private licensing and management system on top of YouTube. In addition,
```
YouTube offers separate licensing deals with music publishers to pay them for music usage on
the platform through ad revenue and subscriptions.
Task 2: Fair Use Experiments
I uploaded an original 15-second video trailer for the movie Zodiac, followed by another
```
15-second trailer where I had done a quick dub on the video (called Copyright Version and
```
```
Commentary Version, respectively).
```
The Copyright Version was immediately detected to be copyrighted while it was still uploading,
```
which is in line with YouTube’s Content ID claims (see “Copyright” tag); however, the
```
Commentary Version never received a copyright
warning even after upload.
With the Copyright Version, it did not result in a
copyright strike, but it did say it might affect my
ability to monetize the video. The outcome was that both videos remained up, while only one of
them was able to retain monetization. The audio and content remained up and visible for both
videos, though. The options presented to me were under the “Take Action” tab and allowed me
to dispute the claim, saying: “Dispute a claim if
you have the necessary rights to the content, or
other valid reasons. It takes up to 30 days for a
final resolution from the claimant. Your
channel won’t receive a strike if your dispute
gets rejected. Learn more.”
Task 3: AI-Generated Content Investigation
These were the three AI prompts that I used in order of most copyright-infringing to most
original. All images provided were generated using the DALL-E AI tool.
```
Prompt: Create a realistic image of SpongeBob SquarePants standing in a modern city street
```
The AI-generated output that I received was: “I can't create or depict copyrighted characters like
SpongeBob SquarePants in realistic images. However, I can create an image of a cartoonish
yellow sponge character with similar features — like square pants, big eyes, and a cheerful
expression — standing on a modern city street, as long as it's an original character and not a
direct copy of SpongeBob. Would you like me to generate that for you? If so, you can customize
```
the look a bit (e.g., outfit style, time of day, weather, city type).”
```
So, in essence, no image was generated by DALL-E to begin with because it violated the
platform’s copyright content policy.
```
Prompt: Create an animated landscape of a quiet town at sunset in the style of Studio Ghibli
```
The AI-generated output that I received was: “I
can’t directly replicate or generate images in
the style of Studio Ghibli due to copyright
restrictions. However, I can absolutely create a
beautiful, animated-style landscape of a quiet
town at sunset, inspired by elements commonly
seen in Ghibli films — such as warm lighting,
serene atmosphere, lush nature, and a cozy,
nostalgic feel.”
Overall, while the DALL-E platform seemed to flag it for having the ability to potentially violate
copyright standards, it quickly redirected to another viable option that was in line with the user’s
```
request but didn’t violate those standards (best of both worlds). When uploaded to YouTube, it
```
did not generate any copyright flags or result in the removal of the video. Both images were
uploaded successfully on the platform.
```
Prompt: Create an original fantasy city built into a cliffside at sunrise, no references to existing
```
media
The AI-generated output that I received was:
“Here are two original fantasy cliffside cities at
sunrise, each capturing a magical and peaceful
atmosphere with glowing towers, lush gardens,
and elegant stone architecture. Let me know if
you'd like to explore this world further —
perhaps with characters, interior views, or a
night version of the city.”
This seemed to have absolutely no issues
generating without any sort of copyright flag
or warning. This makes it clear that the “original” content that it generates seems to be in line
with the copyright standards they set. When uploaded to YouTube, this video also did not
generate any copyright flags or result in the removal of the video. Both of the generated images
were uploaded successfully to the platform.
Most major AI tools state that the user owns the generated images as long as their usage is in line
```
with the platform’s rules (i.e., DALL-E). However, the company may still use the image you
```
generated to train and improve its existing models. It seems that most of the responsibility falls
on the user to make sure that their outputs don’t violate copyright laws.
Under the current US law, the AI itself is not allowed to own the copyright, and if the human is
meaningfully involved in the creation of the image, the user is allowed to own the copyright. The
creators of the training data do not automatically own the output. There is some legal gray area
around output where human contribution is minimal. However, it seems there is still a lot of legal
debate surrounding whether purely AI-generated works qualify for full copyright privileges.
YouTube’s policy on AI-generated content seems to be that they’re okay with it as long as it
follows community guidelines, doesn’t attempt to deceptively impersonate any real people, and
doesn’t violate copyright law. YouTube will not, however, automatically restrict AI-generated
images, and the enforcement in these cases is dependent on whether or not a copyright holder
manually files a complaint against the work.
Task 4: Legal Analysis
Fair Use Four Factors
```
(A) The purpose of uploading the first clip was not transformative in any way. It was uploaded
```
with no additional commentary, editing, or additional meaning. It was not meant to generate
revenue, but the fact that there was no transformation makes this piece not consistent with fair
```
use. (B) At the same time, the original content is a creative work, which is likely not to receive
```
stronger copyright protection than other works, another factor that is inconsistent with fair use.
```
(C) There was only a short segment used for the upload, but it was still a direct excerpt from the
```
original trailer with absolutely no edits. This factor is a little more gray area since it doesn’t
```
contain too much of the trailer, but still leans towards being against fair use. (D) The use of this
```
clip could substitute for viewing the original clip, especially if viewers look at the specific cut
instead of the source content. Even minimal market harm can still constitute working against fair
use.
Overall, this is unlikely to qualify as fair use, which is in alignment with the platform’s decision
to issue a copyright claim.
```
(A) With our second clip, the version added a short spoken commentary over the original clip.
```
Since the purpose was the commentary, that is favored towards fair use. The content itself was
```
not commercial either, which makes it lean towards fair use. (B) The underlying work is still
```
creative, which leans against fair use. At the same time, courts will perceive this factor less
importantly when the use is highly transformative. Overall, it seems gray area, but leans slightly
```
against fair use for derivative content. (C) Only the portion that was used to support our
```
commentary was used, and the entire trailer was not depicted, nor was any part obscured by the
```
voiceover. This seems to lean in favor of fair use. (D) Viewers cannot substitute this commentary
```
iteration for the original work, and, in fact, it would likely result in more interest in the original
clip. Therefore, there is no minimal market harm, which makes this weigh in favor of fair use.
All in all, the use is likely protected under US copyright law, which is reflected by YouTube’s
decision not to apply copyright restrictions to our Commentary Version.
Case Law
In Google vs. Oracle, the Supreme Court held that copying portions of code for a new,
transformative purpose was fair use. This supports the idea that transformation is more important
than whether or not something was copied. I hold a similar stance in my argument for the
Commentary Version, which transforms the original clip through its commentary. In Campbell vs
Acuff-Rose, we see that the case protects parody as fair use because it gives a new meaning and
message. While the commentary was not parody in nature, it similarly adds new meaning
through commentary, which is consistent with fair use findings.
Gap Analysis
The US law says that fair use protects commentary, criticism, education, and transformative
usage, which is within the parameters of my second upload. YouTube’s policy states that fair use
is allowed under copyright laws, but copyright owners can still claim content through Content
ID. YouTube does not determine fair use in advance. They allow disputes based on fair use, but
that does not automatically protect fair use content from being claimed. What is actually
enforced was revealed through the raw clip being immediately restricted, which aligns with
copyright law and policy platform. The commentary version was not restricted by YouTube’s
automated system, so the platform evaluated fair use before prematurely enforcing.
The only gap that seems present between what the law protects and what the platform automates
is that YouTube prioritizes copyright enforcement over legal nuance. They would rather
overshoot than under, and that’s revealed through content being able to be claimed, blocked, or
demonetized unless the user actively disputes it. This reveals a conservative approach to
copyright law altogether.
